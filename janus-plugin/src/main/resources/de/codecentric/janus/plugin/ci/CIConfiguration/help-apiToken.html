        An API token is necessary in order to create Jenkins build jobs
        during the project bootstrap process.
    </p>

    <strong>How To Retrieve the API Token</strong>
    <p>
        The API token can be retrieved when being logged in in Jenkins with the
        respective user account. Click in the top left corner on the username
        of the currently logged in user. On
        the new page, select <em>Configure</em> in the left navigation bar. The
        loaded page will provide you with the ability to change your name, email
        address and various other user specific data - among others, you can also
        click on <em>Show API Token...</em> (or similar). Copy this token into
        the input field above.
