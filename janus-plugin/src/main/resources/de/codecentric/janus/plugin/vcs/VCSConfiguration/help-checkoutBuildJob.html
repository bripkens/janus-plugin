<div>
    When a project is bootstrapped using the Janus application, a
    repository is created and sources need to be placed in it. For this
    purpose, the repository must be checked out / cloned.

    <p>
        Example build job:
        <pre>git clone git@github.com:codecentric/$NAME.git /home/jenkins/janus-bootstrap/$NAME</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The build job should be parameterized with a string
        parameter called <em>NAME</em>. The value will be the repository's name.
    </p>
