<div>
    Whenever a new repository should be created, this build will be
    executed. This can either be the case when [only] a repository
    or a complete project is created / bootstrapped.

    <p>
        The build job should be parameterized with a string
        parameter called <em>NAME</em>. The value will be the repository's name.
