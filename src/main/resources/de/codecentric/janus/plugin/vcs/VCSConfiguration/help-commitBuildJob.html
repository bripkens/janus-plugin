    After project sources have been placed in the repository's current working
    copy, they need to be committed by this build.

    <p>
        Example build job:
        <pre>
            cd /home/jenkins/janus-bootstrap/$NAME
            git add .
            git commit -m "Initialized project."
            git push -u origin master
        </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        The build job should be parameterized with a string
        parameter called <em>NAME</em>. The value will be the repository's name.
    </p>
